# Milestone 3 – Visualization & Interactivity

- Enhanced Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard_m3.py`) using the cleaned dataset `GlobalWeatherRepository_clean.csv`. [file:52]
- Added interactive controls:
  - Country dropdown for temperature-over-time line chart.
  - Multiselect for countries in a monthly temperature heatmap. [file:52]
- Visualizations now include:
  - Top 10 hottest countries (Plotly bar chart).
  - Temperature vs humidity scatterplot.
  - Time-series line chart for a selected country.
  - Monthly average temperature heatmap by country. [file:52]
- Insights highlighted:
  - Identified consistently hot countries and their average temperatures.
  - Observed seasonal patterns via the month–country heatmap.
  - Quantified extreme events (hot days, heavy rain, strong wind) in summary metrics. [file:52]
- Result: A near-complete interactive dashboard prototype that supports regional, temporal, and extreme-weather exploration. [file:42][file:52]
